# Install the sparseet

1. Compile `libnrfopt.a`
    - I had no problem, just run what the README said
2. Compile sparsenet.m
    - We need to setup `mex -setup` in Matlab, I have encountered several problems, see below


## Find MacOS sdk version number

error message: `xcodebuild: error: SDK "macosx10.7" cannot be located.`

**solution**

```
xcrun --show-sdk-path
```

Here you can find what macosx version. I found out mine is maxcosx10.10

## Setup Mex in Matlab

error message: just does not run.

**solution** [Reference](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/103904-can-i-use-xcode-5-as-my-c-or-c-compiler-in-matlab-8-1-r2013a-or-matlab-8-2-r2013b)

Open Matlab, type in

```
cd(matlabroot)
cd bin
edit mexopts.sh
```
Backup the `mexopts.sh` file in case you messed up.

Replace all instances of 10.7 with 10.10(or your version, say 10.8); there are four of these in all (a fifth may be found in comments only)

Save, and run 

```
mex -setup
```

choose to update your setup.

## update the makefile

error message: in README, it says "First modify the makefile definition for MEXT to be the proper suffix for the mex file for your machine (for SGI's it is mexsg)." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

**solution** [Referece](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17117698/compiling-c-program-into-matlab-format-mac-os-x)

change the related filed in the makefile

```
MEX = /Applications/MATLAB_R2012a.app/bin/mex
MEXT = mexmaci64
```

## Now, run `make` !
