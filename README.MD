# Homework in Probabilistic Models of Visual Cortex

## Homework 1

Topics:

>  Hierarchy of visual processing, Linear Filter and edge detection, Laplacian of Gaussian.

All the information is here.

## Homework 2

Topics:

>  Bayesian Decision theory and Signal Detection theory, Bayesian method on Edge detection, Fourier Transformation, Sparse Coding


Many data files are deleted: `IMAGE.mat`, `IMAGE_RAW.mat`, `patchsin_highfre.mat`,`patchsin_lowfre.mat`. These files can be obtained from _sparenet_ or generated from the code.

Also, figures are deleted. All the figures can be generated from the code.

## Homework 3

Topics:

> Gibbs distribution, Gibbs Sampling, Mean Field Theory, and their relationship

All information is here.

## Homework 4

Topics:

> Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, Deep Network

The Trained model is deleted, but it can be reproduced by the `lua` code. My code did not do a good job in translational invariance and I don't really know why it is the case. There could be a bug I guess.

For the data, unzip the `CNN_final.zip`
