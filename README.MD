All the information is here.

## Homework 2

Topics:

>  Bayesian Decision theory and Signal Detection theory, Bayesian method on Edge detection, Fourier Transformation, Sparse Coding


Many data files are deleted: `IMAGE.mat`, `IMAGE_RAW.mat`, `patchsin_highfre.mat`,`patchsin_lowfre.mat`. These files can be obtained from _sparenet_ or generated from the code.

Also, figures are deleted. All the figures can be generated from the code.

## Homework 3

Topics:

> Gibbs distribution, Gibbs Sampling, Mean Field Theory, and their relationship
